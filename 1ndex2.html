												<h4>President</h4>
											</header>
											<p>WHAT’S UP BOSTON UNIVERSITY!! My name is Oliver Pour, and I’m from Great Neck, New York.
											I’m a sophomore in the College of General Studies, majoring in Public Relations.
											I would like to be YOUR President because student government isn’t only about those involved in Executive Board,
											Judicial, or our Legislative Branch but it’s about involving the 16,000+ students that make Boston University and I
											believe OneBU will be able to enhance our community here!
											Fun fact? I was born on a leap year so I would be the youngest student government President in the history of Boston University at only 5 YEARS OLD!

											<p>Yoo, BU! My name is David Joseph and I’m an Economics major in the Class of 2022 from Winchester, Massachusetts
											(20 minutes outside of Boston). As someone who hasn’t been involved in student government before,
											I think I can bring a fresh, outside perspective, and I want anyone and everyone to become involved with our administration no matter
											what previous experience you’ve had. Something unique about me? I can basically play any instrument, so if you see someone playing the piano,
											or any other instrument, in the GSU... it’s probably me. </p>

											<p>Hey BU! My name is Nyah Jordan, and I’m a sophomore majoring in Journalism and minoring in Political
											Science from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. I’m running to be your Vice President of Internal Affairs because I
											want to foster more open engagement within student government, the university’s administration, and the student body.
											It’s important for every student to feel comfortable in approaching student government not only for their problems, but for events,
											for promotions,	for new ideas, and sometimes, just for a conversation. Fun fact? My hair is naturally red!</p>

									<h3>COMMUNITY</h3>

										<u>Underrepresented Students Week </u>
										<p>We aspire to support each community at BU. This university contains a wide range of students that vary from different countries, races, and backgrounds. We support the LGBTQIA+ community, the various racial groups on campus, and any underrepresented student or organization on campus. Every single person at BU deserves to feel a part of this beautiful and diverse community. Our differences are what makes this institution so unique, and those differences should be celebrated. OneBU desires to make campus feel that even though BU is made of so many people, many cultures, and many identities, we are a family. We are OneBU. 
										</p>
										<p>Throughout Underrepresented Students Week, we would like to highlight	underrepresented student groups at Boston University. OneBU is excited to announce that minority groups, first-generation students, transfer students and students that identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community will be celebrated throughout this week on different days. We plan on promoting various on-campus resources during these days; bringing in FirstGen Connect during the day for first-generation students, ASDB, and mentorship programs offered throughout campus. In addition, we hope for everyone to show their support by wearing planned statement-shirts all throughout the week. To culminate the incredible week and the incredible people, OneBU will host an event on Friday that’ll celebrate ALL underrepresented students.  
										</p>
										<u>ONEGala</u> 
										<p>Here at Boston University, OneBU believes that each and every student should feel proud of the Boston community we are apart of. This end of the year event, ONEGala, will be to create community while showcasing Boston University’s greatest talent! This night will be where the Boston University community can celebrate students in different fields of art while also coming together for the greater good of philanthropy. It’ll be unique compared to other formal events as ALL proceeds will go to a nearby charity! OneBU would like to collaborate with ALL student organizations including, but not limited to; art groups, community engagement organizations, cultural clubs, and groups in and around campus to ensure an extraordinary philanthropic event. We believe that coming together for a great cause will ignite a feeling of togetherness and inclusiveness throughout our campus while also helping organizations boost their presence on Boston University’s campus.
										</p>
										<u>Out of Office, Office Hours</u>
										<p>OneBU wants to maintain constant communication with all organizations who are willing to meet in order to make sure every voice is heard and their actions are carried out. We want to implement bi-weekly meetings with representatives from organizations and clubs called Out of Office, Office Hours, where representatives from clubs and organizations to promote transparency with our administration. Our goal is to continually update those clubs with our progress, giving them a space to communicate with Executive Board members directly. Furthermore, we will send out a weekly newsletter updating the student body on any events and news necessary.  
										</p>



									<h3>HEALTH</h3>

										<u>Self Care Wednesdays</u>
										<p>Need a moment to relax and unwind? Taking care of your mental and physical health is often not considered a task one puts on their daily agenda. OneBU wants students to refresh themselves constantly. Working to become the best version of yourself takes time. 
										</p>
										<p>If elected, OneBU will commit to hosting weekly gatherings where students will be able to journal, vent, wear a face mask, drink tea, or simply take a break from their daily responsibilities. Self-care is a continual process, and we want to help our community in the best way we can. That is why we want to work with the Boston University Student Government’s existing <a href="https://www.busgov.org/senate-committees#block-97494645c9d32c884a4e">Mental Health Committee</a> to continue promoting enhanced self-care habits as one community.
										</p>
										<u>Wellness Fairs</u>
										<p> <a href="https://www.who.int/mental_health/world-mental-health-day/">World Mental Health Day</a> is observed on October 10th every year with the overall mission to raise awareness of mental health issues and to mobilize efforts in support of mental health. On October 10th, 2020, OneBU plans to host a Mental Health Awareness and Wellness Fair to expand awareness for this significant day across Boston University’s campus. This fair will include but is not limited to yoga and mediation services, tips for one’s physical, sexual, and mental health, along with stress-relieving giveaways. 
										</p>
										<u>Health Blog</u>
										<p>If voted in, OneBU would like to provide Boston University students with a platform where they will be able to discuss proper health practices while also being able to share advice that they use for themselves. For the proper health practices, we will partner with <a href="http://www.bu.edu/shs/">Student Health Services</a>, <a href ="http://www.bu.edu/shs/sarp/">SARP</a>, and various wellness student organizations here at BU to provide students with quality, up-to-date information on all things health. This platform would behave as a one-stop shop for any advice or information relevant to the health, wellness, and nutrition for members of the BU community. Along with references to the wellness resources on campus, a blog portion for students will be available to discuss and share any relevant information and useful tips for a variety of topics, building community through collaboration and mutual benefit.
										</p>

										<p>The Innovation Pathway is <a href="http://www.bu.edu/innovate/">Innovate@BU</a>’s keystone program that fosters and encourages all types of new ideas created by current Boston University students. OneBU will look to promote this inspiring pathway because whether students want to launch a new business or nonprofit, or dream of creating a community event or campus initiative, this self-paced program is made of four stages (Get Inspired, Walk, Run, Fly) which will guide students toward the inspiration, resources, and opportunities needed to develop new ventures or projects.
